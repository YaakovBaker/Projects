<p><a href = "https://github.com/YaakovBaker/Projects/tree/main/YeshivaUniversityCS/IntroToCS/SpreadSheet"><Strong>CellSpreadSheet</Strong></a>
  <br>•	Multi-file array-based spreadsheet written in Java. The <i>CellSpreadSheet</i> class implemented the <i>CellProvider</i> interface, and stores either a <i>FormulaCell</i> or <i>DoubleCell</i>, both implementing the <i>Cell</i> interface. These Cells and the row and column dimensions are given via command line arguments (i.e. PP H 20 F4 10 B4 5 C4 10/5) and interpreted into a two-dimensional array. Then after interpretting the data given the data is either printed to the terminal in PP or CSV format.</P>
