<p><a href = "https://github.com/YaakovBaker/Projects/tree/main/YeshivaUniversityCS/IntroToCS/SpreadSheet"><Strong>CellSpreadSheet</Strong></a>
  <br>•	Multi-file array-based spreadsheet written in Java. The <i>CellSpreadSheet</i> class implemented the <i>CellProvider</i> interface, and stores either a <i>FormulaCell</i> or <i>DoubleCell</i>, both implementing the <i>Cell</i> interface. The spreadsheet is constructed by passing in arguments into the CellSpreadSheet constructor specifying the row and column size of the spreadsheet. Afterwards the client can call a setValue() method to store data in the spreadsheet at the specified location. If the user wants a visualization of the spreadsheet then they can call getSpreadSheetAsCSV(boolean) by passing in true if they want it to show the formulas and false if they want the formulas to be calculated and then a spreadsheet in CSV format with those specifications is printed.</P>

  <br>•	Coded a Video Game Simulation of Doom with Java as the final project for Intro to Computer Science. This consisted of two files containing enums for the Weapons, and MonsterTypes. The Player, Monster, and Room objects. And the class that ran the simulations: GameBot. 
  
<p><a href = "https://github.com/YaakovBaker/Projects/tree/main/MyProjects/RockPaperScissors/rpsgame"><Strong>Command Line Rock, Paper, Scissors</Strong></a>
  <br>•	Built a command line rock, paper, scissors game in Java by having the user input the number of wins needed, then have the program pick a random choice from an array of choices and then compares it to the option the user inputs tracking the score until a player wins.
